Customer Personality Analysis using K-means Clustering Algorithm
This repository contains code and data for performing customer personality analysis using the K-means clustering algorithm. The goal of this analysis is to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior and preferences. The K-means clustering algorithm is used to group customers into clusters, allowing us to understand their shared characteristics and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of customer transaction data, including variables such as purchase history, spending patterns, and demographic information. The data is preprocessed and prepared for the K-means clustering algorithm.
# To run the customer personality analysis, follow these steps:
Ensure that Python and the necessary dependencies (such as scikit-learn, streamlit) are installed.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook or script that contains the code for the analysis.
Adjust any parameters or settings, such as the number of clusters, based on your specific requirements.
Run the code to perform the K-means clustering algorithm on the customer dataset.
Analyze the resulting customer segments and their characteristics.
# Results
The K-means clustering algorithm identifies distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior. Each cluster represents a specific customer personality or preference. The analysis provides insights into the different segments, allowing businesses to understand their customers better and develop targeted strategies for each group. The results can help optimize marketing campaigns, personalize offerings, and enhance the overall customer experience.
